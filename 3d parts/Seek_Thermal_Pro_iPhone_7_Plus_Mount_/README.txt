# Summary

Recently I purchased a Seek CompactPro (Thermal Imager) and wasn't comfortable with the way the Camera mounted on the Lightning port.  Firstly, the device is costly and  I didn't want it to fall out or break off.  Secondly the mounting felt awkward during use.

This is a simple mount the encompasses the Seek CompactPro and snaps on the back of my iPhone 7 Plus with Tech 21 case.  Because I know most people aren't going to have my phone/case combo I included the Rhino File.

** I assume this will work for all of their versions (Compact & CompactXR) including the micro USB, however I have no way of confirming it.
